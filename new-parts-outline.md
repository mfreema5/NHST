## Outline the doc

First we'll look at how a statistically significance result can be either important or trivial, and to further explain what it is that statistical significance measures, we'll discuss Type I and Type II errors, specifically in relation to correlation analyses.

Then, given our renewed understanding of statistical significance, we'll discuss why bigger isn't always better when it comes to data. One of the specific problems covered will be how using big data can obscure important results with trivial ones.  A related issue is the failure of authors to interpret the results of regression analyses of big data, which increases the difficulty of finding the important results among the larger number of trivial ones.

After a brief section on why this distinction between important and trivial effects is particularly important to management studies, we will give some guidelines for both how to read and how to report the correlation analysis results of empirical studies in management.
