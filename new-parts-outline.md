## Outline the doc

First we'll look at how a statistically significance result can be either important or trivial, and to further explain what it is that statistical significance measures, we'll discuss Type I and Type II errors, specifically in relation to correlation analyses.

Then, given our renewed understanding of statistical significance, we'll discuss why bigger isn't always better when it comes to data. One of the specific problems covered will be how using big data can obscure important results with trivial ones.  A related issue is the failure of authors to interpret the results of regression analyses of big data, which increases the difficulty of finding the important results among the larger number of trivial ones.

After a brief section on why this distinction between important and trivial effects is particularly important to management studies, we will give some guidelines for both how to read and how to report the correlation analysis results of empirical studies in management.

# Confusing "Significant" and "Important"
## Why/how significant results can be either important or trivial

“Statistical significance” is a mathematically pure characteristic of a correlation.  By which I mean that it doesn't require any interpretation, and also that it is independent of the particular phenomena which the correlation's variables describe.

In other words, it doesn't matter what you are measuring to get the numbers which are the data in your analysis; the resulting statistical significance won't change if you switch units of measure, or even if you change the thing being measured&mdash;as long as you get exactly the same measurements, that is.

Statistical significance comes from the numbers themselves, not the real-world things and events that the numbers represent.

Importance, however, is very dependent on the reality behind the numbers.  It is also dependent on the context of the numbers, and, indeed, the context of the analysis itself.  This is not to say that “importance” is completely subjective, but rather that there is no set formula to calculate it.

So, importance is dependent on what the numbers represent, and significance is not.  How are they related to each other then?  Importance is dependent on statistical significance.  Importance depends on statistical significance because if the numbers themselves fail to meet the criteria to qualify as statistically significant, then it doesn't really matter what they represent.  They're not confirming anything, so how can we say whether they are important or not?

Significance doesn't necessarily depend on importance because it doesn't depend on the what the numbers represent.  Calculations of statistical significance are completely uniformed by what it is being measured and analyzed.

But here's the twist: while the calculation of statistical significance is independent of the importance of the data, the final result&mdash;whether or not a correlation is “statistically significant”&mdash;is dependent on the importance, because the importance determines what the cut-off point for “significance” is.

While the 95% confidence level, a.k.a., “p<.05”, has become a *de facto* standard in the management literature, it's a largely arbitrary one.  We could make the cut-off “p<.01”, “p<.001”, or “p<.10”, or “p<.333” for that matter.  In other words, we could report with whatever level of confidence we think is appropriate, be it 99%, 99.9%, 90% or even 66.7%. **[CONFIDENCE-LEVEL CITES]**

As Cohen explains **[CITE]**, for potentially important results it often makes sense to lower the criteria as to what qualifies as statistically significant.

# What does “statistical significant” actually mean?

If the cut-off for what qualifies as statistically significant is a variable we can set, why not just set it low enough that everything qualifies?
