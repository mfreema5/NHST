## Summary of recommended questions

#### Are the authors using the word ‘significant’ to mean ‘important’, and is that use justified?

| Reader | Author |
|--------|--------|
| <ul><li>Do they mean that an effect is definitely real, or that it's large enough to be important?</li></ul> | <ul><li>Don't use “significant” when you mean “important”.</li><li>Don't use “significant” to describe anything other than “statistical significance”.</li></ul> |

#### What was the statistical power of the analysis?

| Reader | Author |
|--------|--------|
| <ul><li>Is the statistical power reported anywhere in the paper?</li></ul> | <ul><li>If you targeted a statistical power in the design of the experiment, report that.</li><li>If you're doing a post-analysis calculation of the power, use the minimum magnitude of correlation that would qualify as important enough to report as the effect size in the calculation.<li>Explain the minimum magnitude used.</li></li></ul> |

#### Have the authors interpreted the statistics in a meaningful way?

| Reader | Author |
|--------|--------|
| <ul><li>Are the correlation coefficients standardized, or are they in terms of their respective units of measure?</li><li>Does the paper go beyond explaining the existence of correlations, and also explain their size of effect?</li></ul> | <ul><li>Could a strategic manager use your results to make a decision?<li>Have you explained the units of measure and the context?</li><li>W - Have you explained the minimum size of effect that was included?</li></li></ul> |

#### What is the size of variation in the outcome?

| Reader | Author |
|--------|--------|
| <ul><li>How much of a change in outcome did the correlation explain?</li><li>Is that amount of change in outcome worth pursuing?</li></ul> | <ul><li>When you interpreted the correlation coefficient in units of measure useful for a manager, did you also interpret the outcome&mdash;the dependent variables&mdash;into useful units of measure?</li><li>Did you discuss your results in relation to the full range of variation typical in the entire market, or only the variation in outcomes included in the data?</li></ul> |

#### Why is there no research that covers what I'm looking for? / What if I don't get any statistically significant results?

| Reader | Author |
|--------|--------|
| <ul><li>Is it possible that the relationship for which you're looking for research results doesn't actually exist?</li></ul> | <ul><li>Check the statistical power; if it's high, maybe you do have important results.</li><li>Consider the magnitude of the size of effect you found; if it's high enough to be important, you can argue to lower the bar for statistical significance.</li></ul> |
