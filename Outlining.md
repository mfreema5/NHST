## Something outline-like from old draft

1. Confusing "Significant" and "Important"
1. Results-Driven v. Theory-Driven
  1. Type II errors
1. Is it Theory Driven?
  1. Negative results?
  1. Intimate “data-mining”
1. Dominance of Large Data Sets
  1. See “T-test” below
1. The Hidden Bias Against Importance
  1. Small data sets --> large effects
  1. Large data sets --> large and small effects
  1. Only large data sets? --> Large effects are outnumbered by small effects
1. Losing the Important Results
  1. “…even when important results get published, we won't know that they are important.”
1. Business is Not an Abstraction
  1. “…the magnitude of the effect size that will indicate the relative benefit to practitioners…”

### T-test:
```
        r*SQRT(n-2)  <-- (¿ estimate of spread of curve ?)
    t = -----------
        SQRT(1-r^2)  <-- (effective 'r' for variance *not* accounted for)
                      r = coefficient of correlation
                      n = number of data points in sample
                      degrees of freedom = (n-2)
  Combine with “winged diagram” of alpha and beta?
```

### But first…

* Who is the audience?
  * University instructors / professors
  * Undergraduate / graduate students
  * Note: **not** practitioners
* What's the angle?
  * ¿ “Don't do this” ?
  * ¿ “Question this” ?
    * If you do “Question this”, should be easy to tack on “Don't do this” appendix
  * Straight to students, or via instructors / professors?
    * Wrap straight-to-students in a speaking-to-profs container?

So, a completely abstract, generalized outline:

1. Explain purpose and approach to profs
1. Explain issues to students
1. Recommend ways to read
1. Recommend ways to write

## Re-working what's above

1. Confusing "Significant" and "Important"
  1. Why/how significant results can be either important or trivial
1. What does “statistical significant” actually mean?
  1. Type I errors – Mistaking shrubs for trees
  1. Type II errors – Missing forest for trees
1. Beware Large Data Sets
  1. See “T-test”
  1. Combs quote
  1. Present “winged diagram” of alpha and beta
    * Type I and II errors revisited
1. The Hidden Bias Against Importance
  1. Small data sets --> large effects
  1. Large data sets --> large and small effects
  1. Only large data sets? --> Large effects are outnumbered by small effects
1. Losing the Important Results
  1. “…even when important results get published, we won't know that they are important.”
1. Business is Not an Abstraction
  1. “…the magnitude of the effect size that will indicate the relative benefit to practitioners…”
  1. Strategic managers need to know what the practical implications are
1. How to read empirical studies in management literature
  1. If you are a strategic manager, look for…
1. How to report empirical studies in management literature
  1. If you think strategic managers should make use of your results…
  1. (If you think your results are irrelevant to strategic managers, then…)
